# PlacesOfInterest
Project by Alon Shulman

A college project made in April 2016

Places of interest is combining google map API and factual API to search and show places of interest around you.
Search for places by radius and category or just show all the nearest places around you.
Save places to favorites, and automatically show the last search results on startup.

In order to activate the google map API, replace the key in the project.

A lot of difficulties occurred while trying to make the map work while changing the orientation of the device.

As the project was finished before learning drawers and material design, it lacks those.
