# PlacesOfInterest
Project by Alon Shulman

A college project made in april 2016
Places of interest is combining google map api and factual api to search and show places of interest around you
search for places by radius and category or just show all the nearest places around you
save places to favorites, and auto show the last search results on startup

in order to activate the google map api, replace the key in the project

a lot of difficulties occured while trying to make the map work while changing the orientation of the device

as the project was finished before learning drawers and material design, it lacks those
